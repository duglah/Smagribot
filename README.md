Smagribot ðŸŒ± is an open source indoor iot plant sensor.

It takes control of the environmental circumstances for growing vegetables and herbs in your own home. It monitors the temperature, humidity and the moisture of the plantâ€™s soil. The monitored data allows the system to control a grow light and a water pump to optimize the health and growth of the plants from sowing to harvest.
